# Nepdora — Complete Setup Guide

Follow this streamlined process to set up your Nepdora store: **add data first → build your website**.

## Workflow Overview

**Phase 1: Data Setup** (Must do first)
1. Create main categories
2. Add subcategories (optional but recommended)
3. Add products and assign categories
4. Review and verify all data

**Phase 2: Website Building** (After data is ready)
1. Open Website Builder
2. Create pages using your categories/products
3. Customize design and layout
4. Preview and publish

## Phase 1: Add Categories & Products First

### 1. Create Categories

Categories are the foundation of your store's navigation. Create them first in your Nepdora admin.

**Via Admin UI:**
`Catalog → Categories → Add Category`

**Tips:**
- Use short, SEO-friendly slugs (`/clothing`, `/electronics`)
- Add a category image if your theme supports banners
- Think about your main product groupings

### 2. Add Subcategories (Optional but Recommended)

Subcategories help organize products within categories and improve user navigation.

**Via Admin UI:**
`Catalog → Categories → Select Parent → Add Subcategory`

**Example JSON:**
```json
{
  "name": "T-Shirts",
  "slug": "t-shirts",
  "parentCategoryId": "<clothing-category-id>"
}
```

### 3. Add Products

Now add your products and assign them to categories/subcategories.

**Minimum Fields Required:**
- title / name
- SKU (unique identifier)
- price (with currency)
- categoryId or slug
- images (array of URLs)
- description


**Bulk Import Option:**
Use CSV with headers: `title,sku,price,currency,category,subcategory,images,stock,description`

### 4. Verify Your Data

Before building your website, ensure everything is correct:

**From Admin → Products → Edit:**
- Images load correctly
- Category assignments are right
- Pricing and descriptions are accurate
- SEO fields are filled

## Phase 2: Build Your Website

**Important:** Only proceed to website building after your categories and products are set up and verified.

### Open Website Builder

After your data is ready, go to **Website Builder** in your Nepdora admin.

### Create Pages

1. **Category Listing Pages**
   - Use the **Category Listing** template
   - Connect to your category slugs
   - Display products in that category

2. **Product Detail Pages**
   - Use the **Product Page** template
   - Connect to specific product SKUs
   - Show product images, descriptions, pricing

### Customize Your Site

**Data Mapping:**
- **Hero Section:** `product.images[0]` or `category.image`
- **Product Title:** `product.title`
- **Price Display:** `product.price + " " + product.currency`
- **Description:** `product.description`
- **Add to Cart:** `product.sku`

**Navigation & Filters:**
- Add sidebar filters for subcategories
- Include price range filters
- Set up search functionality
- Create navigation menus pointing to category pages

### Preview & Publish

- Use **Preview Mode** to test on mobile & desktop
- Test the complete user journey (browse → product → cart → checkout)
- Click **Publish** when everything looks good

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't skip data setup** - Website builder won't work well without proper categories and products
**Don't use inconsistent slugs** - Changing them later breaks links
**Don't forget images** - Visuals are crucial for e-commerce
**Don't skip testing** - Always preview before publishing

## Pro Tips

- **Staging First:** Use a staging environment for testing
- **Product Tags:** Add tags like `bestseller`, `new-arrival` for better organization
- **Mobile Optimization:** Always test on mobile devices
- **SEO:** Fill out all SEO fields for better search rankings
