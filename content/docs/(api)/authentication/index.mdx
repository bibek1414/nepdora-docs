# Authentication

The authentication API provides endpoints for user login, registration, and password management.

## Overview

Authentication is required for most API endpoints. This section covers:

- User registration and signup
- Login and session management
- Password changes and resets
- Email verification

## Endpoints

### User Registration

- `POST /api/signup/` - Create a new user account
- `POST /api/verify_email/` - Verify email address

### User Login

- `POST /api/customer_login/` - Authenticate user credentials

### Password Management

- `POST /api/change_password/` - Update user password
- `POST /api/resend_verification/` - Resend verification email

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: User signs up with email and password
2. **Email Verification**: User clicks verification link in email
3. **Login**: User authenticates with credentials
4. **Access**: User receives JWT token for API access

## Security

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limiting applies to authentication endpoints
