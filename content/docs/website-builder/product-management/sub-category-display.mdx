# Subcategory Display

The **Subcategory Display** component in the Nepdora Website Builder lets you organize your products within **nested category structures**.  
Subcategories help users navigate your store more efficiently by refining broad categories into more specific groups.

---

## Adding a Subcategory Display Section

1. In the **builder interface**, open the **Components** panel from the left sidebar.
2. Select **Subcategory Display**.
3. The component will be added to your page layout, showing subcategories under their parent category.
4. Once added, a **Manage Subcategories** button will appear in the component toolbar.

---

## Managing Subcategories

Click **Manage Subcategories** to open the **Subcategory Management Page**.  
Here you can create, edit, or remove subcategories that belong to a specific parent category.

---

## Creating a New Subcategory

Click **Create New Subcategory** to open the creation form.  
You’ll see the following input fields:

---

### 1. **Subcategory Name**

Enter the name of your subcategory.  
Example: `Laptops`, `Shoes`, `Home Lighting`, etc.

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">
  Keep subcategory names simple and descriptive — this helps users quickly find
  the products they’re interested in.
</Callout>

---

### 2. **Subcategory Description**

Provide a brief description of what the subcategory contains.  
Example:

> Browse our collection of premium laptops and notebooks from top brands.

---

### 3. **Parent Category**

Each subcategory must belong to a parent category.  
Select one from the **dropdown list** of available categories.

<Callout type="info" title="Why Parent Categories Matter">
  This ensures that subcategories are properly grouped under main product
  categories — for example, **Electronics → Laptops** or **Clothing → Shoes**.
</Callout>

---

### 4. **Subcategory Image**

Upload an image that visually represents the subcategory.

- Click **“Choose File”** or drag and drop an image into the upload area.
- Maximum file size: **5 MB**
- Supported formats: **JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF**

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Use clean, square images (e.g., 800x800 px) to maintain consistency in grid
  layouts.
</Callout>

---

### 5. **Actions**

After filling in the details:

- **Save / Create** → Adds the new subcategory to the selected parent category.
- **Cancel** → Discards the changes and returns to the management screen.

---

## Editing Existing Subcategories

To edit a subcategory:

1. Click the **Manage Subcategories** button.
2. Select the subcategory you want to edit.
3. Update its name, description, parent category, or image.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

Changes will automatically reflect in the **Subcategory Display** component.

---

## Display Options

The **Subcategory Display** section supports multiple layout styles — including grid, list, or card displays.  
Each layout automatically pulls subcategory data linked to its parent category.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Ensure your subcategory images have consistent aspect ratios to maintain a
  clean and professional look across layouts.
</Callout>

---

## Best Practices

- Always link each subcategory to a valid **parent category**.
- Keep subcategory names short and clear.
- Use visually distinct images to make browsing easier.
- Avoid creating unnecessary subcategories — only add them when a category contains multiple distinct product types.
- Use meaningful descriptions to improve **SEO** and clarity.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Add a **Subcategory Display** component to your page.
2. Click **Manage Subcategories** → **Create New Subcategory**.
3. Fill out the fields:
   - **Name:** “Laptops”
   - **Description:** “Explore our wide range of laptops for home and office.”
   - **Parent Category:** “Electronics”
   - **Image:** Upload a suitable product photo
4. Click **Save**.
5. The new subcategory automatically appears under the **Electronics** category in your site’s Subcategory Display.
